<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Madhusmita Sahoo. I am 30 years old. I have done my schooling & PUC in my hometown. I have done my graduation from a college under N.O.U. I have done my MCA from I.G.I.T Sarang, Dhenkanal, a renowned college under BPUT. I have completed my masters in the year 2017. I was in Hyderabad for the project work for couple of months. Then i moved to Bangalore. I started doing job in IT from 2018 to 2021. </p>

<p>Coming to my personal life, i stay with my mother & i have an elder sister. My father has left this world on 26th of September 2004. I was a kid of 12 years old while i lost my father forever. Still my mother has never let us feel his absence. I have a nephew who is 10 years old & is very naughty. I love my family sooo much. </p>

<p>At present, i am learning Frontend Development course to get Back to IT again. I was preparing for UPSC from 2021 to 2023. Then i met someone who made me realise the actual goal of my life & stood by me as if my shadow is intact with me. I will always be grateful to that person who has been with me from past couple of months but has become the most vital part of my life since then. </p>
